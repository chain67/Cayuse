The backend project should run fine from visual studio and meet the basic requirements.
 the web meets the basic stretch requirements:
npm install -g http-server
http-server -o
click on index.htm
click on weather link

enter a zipcode

I will be working on the things to do.
as of 1:00 12/9
to do: 
unit test external services
int test with faked remote webservices
finish stretch goal(angularjs spa) beyond quick page to test connection and zip functionality
bootstrap or material, newer angular, make it look nice, etc..
zip code validation
js tests using jasmine
handle (do not swallow... maybe log) server errors from remote... 
more logging
